1. module-lever logger, in each module which uses logging, named as follows:
    ```logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)```
This means that logger names track the package/module hierarchy, and itâ€™s intuitively obvious where events are logged just from the logger name.

However, as mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50714316/how-to-use-logging-getlogger-name-in-multiple-modules
the logger has a hierachy, which musted be defined explicitly in the logger name, using dot-notation.

In the example here, the logger name in the `main_module.py` is `spam_application`;
then the logger name in `auxiliary_mode.py` must be `spam_application.xx`


2. set level is required

4.1 practice 1: setting logging levels
4.2 practice 2: logging from mudule `logging.getLogger(__name__)`
4.3 configuring logging:  In general, a configuration consists of adding a Formatter and a Handler to the root logger.  Applications should configure logging as early as possible, preferably as the first thing in the application, so that log messages do not get lost during startup. Finally, applications should wrap a try/except block around the main application code to send any exceptions through the logging interface instead of just to stderr


example: 
```python
import logging
import logging.handlers
import os
 
handler = logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(
    os.environ.get("LOGFILE", "/var/log/yourapp.log"))
formatter = logging.Formatter(logging.BASIC_FORMAT)
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
root = logging.getLogger()
root.setLevel(os.environ.get("LOGLEVEL", "INFO"))
root.addHandler(handler)
 
try:
    exit(main())
except Exception:
    logging.exception("Exception in main()")
    exit(1)
```
